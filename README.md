#Quality Classification of Plant Seeds Using Python

This project classifies the quality of plant seeds (High, Medium, or Low) using a simple rule-based Python program based on seed characteristics such as weight, size, color, and texture.

✅ Project Overview
The program:
Takes input from the user (seed weight, size, color, texture)
Assigns a score to each characteristic
Calculates the total score
Classifies the seed as High, Medium, or Low Quality
No advanced libraries or machine learning models are used—this is a beginner-friendly, logic-based approach.

🛠️ Software Requirements
Python 3.x	- Required to run the code
No external libraries required.
